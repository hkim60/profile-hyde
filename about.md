  Looking at the issues from a various viewpoint.
</p>

I have developed my professional ability through journalistic reporting and writing and a working experience in at the student organization. I am currently a member of the press at KUSA, the Korean UIowa Student Association. Not only the writing but also by taking multimedia storytelling, I have technological skills in Adobe Photoshop and Final Cut. 

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
