  *Looking at the Issues from Various Viewpoints.*
</p>

My name is HyunJung Kim and double majoring in Journalism and Mass Communication and International Studies at the University of Iowa.

As a journalist, I focus on the issue, provide accurate information and inspire readers to cultivate critical thinking. In case of my second interest in PR, I care about diverse features that can balance the different perspectives in communication industry.

I have developed my professional ability through journalistic reporting and writing and a working experience in at the student organization. I am currently a member of the press at KUSA, the Korean UIowa Student Association. Not only the writing but also by taking multimedia storytelling, I have technological skills in Adobe Photoshop and Final Cut.
