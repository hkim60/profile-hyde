  Looking at the Issues from Various Viewpoints
</p>

My name is HyunJung Kim and double majoring in *Journalism and Mass Communication and International Studies with International Communication and Information Track* at the University of Iowa.

As a journalist, I focus on the issue, provide accurate information and inspire readers to cultivate critical thinking. For my second interest in PR, I care about diverse features that can balance the different perspectives in communication industry.

I have developed my professional ability through journalistic reporting and writing and a working experience at the student organization. I am currently a member of the press at KUSA, the Korean UIowa Student Association. Not only writing but also by taking multimedia storytelling, I have technological skills in Adobe Photoshop and Final Cut.
